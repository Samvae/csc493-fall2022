# Star Splitter : Image Partitioning with A* for Astrophotography
## Description/Motivation

Star Splitter will utilize the A* algorithm, a pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency and effectiveness in traversing graphs, to create paths for dividing astrophotography images into meaningful segments. The GUI will allow users to interactively define segmentation parameters, such as brightness thresholds or region of interest markers, and visualize the segmentation process in real-time. Additionally, users will have the flexibility to customize the partitioning algorithm's parameters to suit their specific analysis needs.

### Prerequisites

Python IDE: Ensure you have a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your system. Popular choices include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.

Python Libraries:
*These can be installed using:*
- numpy: 
`pip install numpy`
- OpenCV (cv2): 
`pip install opencv-python`
- matplotlib: 
`pip install matplotlib`


## Built With

Star Splitter: Image partitioning with A* for Astrophotography was built using the following frameworks and libraries:

PyCharm: The project is written in Python programming language.
numpy: Used for numerical computing and array manipulation in Python.
OpenCV (cv2): OpenCV is a computer vision library used for image processing tasks.
matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python, used for visualizing image segmentation results.
A Algorithm*: The A* algorithm is employed for pathfinding and image partitioning.
