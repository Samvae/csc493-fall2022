# Star Splitter : Image Partitioning with A* for Astrophotography

## Goals

The primary goal of Star Splitter: Image partitioning with A* for Astrophotography is to provide astronomers and researchers with a user-friendly tool for partitioning astrophotography images, allowing for better analysis and exploration of celestial objects. By automating and simplifying the image segmentation process, the project aims to accelerate the data analysis workflow and facilitate the discovery of new insights in astrophotography data.


## Context

Astrophotography produces a large amount of image data containing celestial objects, such as stars and galaxies. Existing tools for image segmentation often require advanced technical expertise and lack user-friendly interfaces. Star Splitter aims to address these limitations by providing a simple, interactive tool specifically designed for astrophotography image partitioning.

## Novelty

The novelty of Star Splitter is the combination of user-friendly GUI interface, real-time visualization, and utilization of the A* algorithm for image partitioning. While there are existing tools and libraries for image segmentation, Star Splitter offers an accessible and intuitive solution tailored for researchers. 

## Functionality

Star Splitter is expected to provide these functionalities:

- Graphical User Interface for interactive image partitioning
- Real-time visualization of segmentation results
- Customizable segmentation parameters
- Export functionality for segmented images

## Audience

The intended audience for Star Splitter includes the general public, those interested in astrophotography, and researchers in the field of astronomy. The main usability goals are to provide a tool that is easy to use, even for users with limited technical expertise, and to enhance the enjoyment and accessibility of exploring astrophotography images.


## Challenges

Some anticipated challenges during the development of Star Splitter may include:

- Implementing the A* algorithm efficiently for image partitioning
- Designing an intuitive and responsive GUI interface
- Incorporating differential brightness to cleanly split images with great light variance 
- Efficiently saving a specified area of an image that has been split into multiple sections. 

## Measures

The success of Star Splitter will be measured based on the following criteria:

- User feedback and satisfaction with the usability and functionality of the tool
- Accuracy and efficiency of image partitioning results

## Motivation

The primary motivation for choosing this project is the opportunity to contribute to the field of astronomy and make a meaningful impact on the accessibility and usability of tools for astrophotography analysis. By developing Star Splitter, I hope to provide astronomers and those interested with a resource for studying stars in space. Additionally, I believe that working on this project will enhance my skills in software development, image processing, and user interface design, ultimately benefiting my career development in the field of technology and scientific research.
